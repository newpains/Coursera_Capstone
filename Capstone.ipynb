    "In this lab, precede the severity of a car accident. Car accidents are more common around the world than we imagine, these accidents can be due to critical road conditions, rain, wind, etc., that caused it. The idea is to have a tool that allows drivers to know the possibility of having a car accident accident and how serious it would be, so that they can drive more carefully or even change the date of their trip if they can. Let's use data for Seattle city of how to deal with the accidents data."
